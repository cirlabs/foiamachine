Dear {{firstname}} {{lastname}},
<br/>
<p>
Welcome to FOIA Machine! We're encouraged by your interest and excited by the power we have as a collected body of interested, engaged users of open records laws.
</p>
<p>
This project is still in development. Soon it will be available to a select group of early users who will serve as our beta testers. Then we'll expand that group to include you in the coming weeks and months. We'll invite you via email. Stay tuned.
</p>
<p>
Expect to hear more from us in the weeks ahead. Please help us shape this project by joining the discussion in our <a href="http://www.foiamachine.org/community/">Google users group</a> or on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/foiamachine">@foiamachine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks from the FOIA Machine team!
